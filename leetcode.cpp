33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int first = 0, last = nums.size();
        while(first != last){
           const int mid = first + (last- first)/2;
            if(nums[mid] == target) 
                return mid;
            if(nums[first] <= nums[mid]){
                if(nums[first] <= target && target < nums[mid])
                    last = mid;
                else
                    first = mid + 1;
            }else{
                if(nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[last-1])
                    first = mid +1;
                else
                    last = mid;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
